This is a brief overview of the voice control functionality of this application.

1) On startup, you can select to play against an AI or a friend by saying "singleplayer" or "multiplayer" when
prompted.
2) During gameplay, you may either:
    2.1) Quit by saying "exit"
    2.2) Restart by saying "new game"
    2.3) Make a move. To do so, simply say the location of the board to place your piece on.
        This should feel intuitive, but for the sake of being explicit:
