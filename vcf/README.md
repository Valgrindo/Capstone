# Voice Control Integration Framework

> This is an implementation of my Master's Capstone project. For now, the details of how to use the
> framework are available in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I2TXpoxAGi8i7pS_5ZhfxTfaxTDmH-BGmxOjusGlWiE/edit?usp=sharing).

I may revisit this in the future and write a detailed installation and usage guide here.
